# Cleanup Summary

Removed legacy build and backup directories from the repository root to keep the tree focused on production assets:

- `dist/`
- `fase2_1_dark_tracking_clean/`
- `sales-capsulas-merged/`
- `.DS_Store`
- `.codex_ok`
- `BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUGGESTIONS.md`

All source files remain untouched; run `npm run build` to validate the project compiles cleanly.
